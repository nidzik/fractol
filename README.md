# Project fractol
>>>>> #####Fractal exploration project.

#####Grade ``(114/100)`` ``(114/125)*``
--------  -----------------------
Goals:
- [X] Use "minilibX", school's truncated version of "X11".
- [X] Read arguments to choose wich fractal to show.
- [X] Mandelbrot set. Zoom with mouse scroll.
- [X] Julia sets. Zoom with mouse scroll. Mouse position defines wich Julia to show.
- [X] One more fractal. Zoom with mouse scroll.

Recommended bonuses:
- [X] Movements.
- [X] Change colors on key press.
- [X] More fractals.
- [ ] 3d representation.
- [ ] Open two frames for two fractals, at the same time.

My additions:
- [X] Change colors on movements of the mouse.
- [X] Freez julia fractal
- [X] Change outlines on Mandelbraut 

Usage:
```sh
make
./fractol [m/j/w/s]
```
